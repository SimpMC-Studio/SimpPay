## Expected Performance Gains

| Component | Improvement | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Build Time | 40-60% faster | Development productivity |
| JAR Size | 20-30% smaller | Faster deployment, less storage |
| Database Operations | 50-70% faster | Better user experience |
| Cache Operations | 60-80% faster | Reduced latency |
| QR Code Generation | 90% faster (cached) | Better responsiveness |
| Memory Usage | 15-25% reduction | Better resource utilization |

## Configuration Migration

### Required Changes
1. Update Java version to 21 in deployment environment
2. Review database configuration for new pool settings
3. Update any hardcoded RCON passwords to use environment variables
4. Review performance settings in main-config.yml

### Optional Optimizations
1. Enable batch operations for high-traffic servers
2. Adjust cache TTL based on usage patterns
3. Configure rate limiting based on server capacity
4. Enable debug mode during initial deployment for monitoring

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor cache hit ratios using the new statistics
2. Watch database connection pool metrics
3. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
4. Track QR code cache utilization
5. Monitor application startup time and stability

## Future Improvements
